I can't see it. Dementia is a progressive condition that impacts cognitive functions, particularly memory. Individuals experiencing dementia may find it challenging to recall recent events, manage daily tasks, or recognize familiar faces. This memory loss can lead to moments of confusion and disorientation, making it difficult for them to navigate their environment. As the condition progresses, other cognitive abilities, such as language and problem-solving skills, can also be affected, further complicating daily life. Caregivers often notice changes in mood and behavior, which can be distressing for both the person with dementia and their loved ones. Who is that. Which one?
